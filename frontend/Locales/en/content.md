### What is Find Your Vaxx?

This website exists to organize information about where and how you can get
vaccinated against COVID-19 in Taiwan. Although the government has rolled out
the [1922 vaccine reservation system](https://1922.gov.tw), there remain other
reservation systems that are in-use. We are currently focused on collecting
information about all these systems in a single location.

### Who built this website?

This website was built by volunteers with the g0v civic hacker network. It is
not associated with the Taiwanese government and is not an official resource.
For official information, please check the [Taiwan CDC's
website](https://cdc.gov.tw).

### How can you help?

This websiteâ€™s information comes from crawling government websites and manually
sorting reservation information. We need your help to build the rest! Please
join the [g0v slack](https://join.g0v.tw) and find us at #vaxxtw.
