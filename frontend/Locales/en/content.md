### Who can get the COVID-19 vaccine?
You can get the COVID-19 vaccine for free if you are part of
the eligible groups set by the Taiwanese government. 

### Are there self-paid vaccines available? 
Self-paid vaccines were available for those who intended to travel
abroad. This program was ended by the CECC on May 15, 2021. 
If you previously got your first dose through this program, you
can schedule your second shot directly with your hospital. 

### What vaccines are available? 
Currently, the Taiwanese government is administering the
AstraZeneca vaccine. 

### How do I use this website? 
Look for hospitals in your area. If the 'Availability' column
on the right says 'Available', then there are COVID-19 out-of-pocket
vaccines available. If it says 'Unavailable', the hospital has
no open appointments. If it says 'No Data', we haven't found a
way to add the data to this website yet. Please check the
hospital directly by clicking on 'Register here'.
